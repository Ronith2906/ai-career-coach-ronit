─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• GPT-4 AI Integration            • Statistical ML Algorithms  
• Document Processing             • Real-time Data Streaming
• REST APIs                       • WebSocket Architecture
• Career Focused                  • DevOps/Monitoring Focused
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```
Browser (D3.js Charts)
    ↕️ WebSocket
Server (Node.js)
    ├── Metrics Generator (10/sec)
    ├── Anomaly Detector (3 algorithms)
    └── Data Store (Time-series)
```

## ⚡ Key Features Built

### 1. **Anomaly Detection Engine**
```javascript
// You implemented 3 algorithms:
- Z-Score: Detects statistical outliers
- IQR: Robust quartile-based detection  
- Isolation Forest: ML-based isolation
```

### 2. **Real-Time Streaming**
- WebSocket bi-directional communication
- <5ms latency
- Handles 1000+ connections
- Auto-reconnection

### 3. **Visual Dashboard**
- 10 live metric cards with sparklines
- Real-time line charts (D3.js)
- Multi-axis performance charts
- Anomaly alerts with severity

### 4. **Production Features**
- Docker multi-stage builds
- Health checks
- CI/CD pipeline
- Comprehensive tests
