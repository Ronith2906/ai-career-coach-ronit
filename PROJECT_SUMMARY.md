### 💡 How to Use This

1. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   cd /workspace/realtime-analytics-dashboard
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Real-time analytics dashboard with anomaly detection"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/realtime-analytics-dashboard.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Choose Your LinkedIn Post**:
