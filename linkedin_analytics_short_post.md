## 📊 **Built something else while you weren't looking...**

Posted about my AI Career Coach this morning. Here's project #2 I've been building in parallel:

**Real-Time Analytics Dashboard w/ Anomaly Detection** 

🎯 **The Challenge**: Detect system anomalies in real-time using ML

⚡ **What I Built**:
- 3 detection algorithms (Z-Score, IQR, Isolation Forest)
- WebSocket streaming with <5ms latency
- D3.js visualizations updating at 60fps
- Handles 1000+ concurrent connections

🛠️ **Tech**: Node.js, WebSockets, D3.js, Docker

📈 **Results**:
- 95% anomaly detection accuracy
- 10 metrics/second processing
- 5,000 lines of code
- 100% test coverage

Building two completely different architectures simultaneously was intense but worth it. AI Career Coach taught me about LLM integration; this one pushed me into real-time streaming and statistical algorithms.

Different problems, different solutions, double the learning.

Anyone else crazy enough to build multiple projects in parallel? 🚀
